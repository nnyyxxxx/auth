.SH FILES
.TP
\fI~/.local/share/auth/auth.db\fR
SQLite database file for TOTP entries

.SH SECURITY
TOTP secrets are stored locally on disk.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B AUTH_DATABASE_DIR
Specifies the directory where the database file (auth.db) is stored. If this variable is not set, the default location $HOME/.local/share/auth/ is used.

.SH COMMON MISTAKES
.TP
\fBMy code says Invalid Key!?!?! What do I do??\fR
It is 100% likely that your keyring is not running.

.TP
\fBI can't add my super special secret with cool symbols!!1!\fR
If your secret contains anything other than letters, numbers, spaces, or hyphens, it will be rejected. Base32 encoding only uses those characters.

.TP
\fBMy 12-digit TOTP code doesn't work?!\fR
The app only supports 6-8 digit codes because that's what every sane authentication app uses. If you need more digits, you might also need therapy.

.TP
\fBAuth says "Period cannot be 0"\fR
The time period has to be greater than 0. Common sense.

.TP
\fBI keep getting "Entry not found" when I KNOW it's there!\fR
You can refer to entries by name or #.

.TP
\fBWhere is my database stored? I want to do dangerous things to it!\fR
By default, it's at \fI~/.local/share/auth/auth.db\fR, but you can change it with the \fBAUTH_DATABASE_DIR\fR environment variable.

.TP
\fBI just installed auth but it says it can't save my entries?!\fR
This happens when you ignored the first recommendation about having a keyring installed. Install and run one of these: GNOME Keyring, KDE Wallet. Yes, this means you have to actually READ the documentation.

.TP
\fBWhy can't I export to my favorite obscure file format?\fR
Because we only support TOML and JSON like normal people.

.TP
\fBI added a bunch of entries and now I regret everything!\fR
Use the \fBwipe\fR command to delete everything.

.TP
\fBI can't edit my entry because "Cannot edit entry with unavailable secret"?\fR
This happens when you're trying to edit an entry but the secret can't be retrieved from the keyring. Please make sure your keyring is running.

.TP
\fBHelp! I'm trying to import but nothing happens!\fR
Double-check your file format. If you claim it's JSON but it's actually a picture of your cat, the import will fail.

.TP
\fBWTF!? My long ass entry name doesn't show the full length and has ... at the end\fR
All entries get truncated at 40 characters, for common reasons.

.TP
\fBNone of the above worked!?!?!? What do i do???\fR
Are you trying to run this on Windows? macOS? Your smartphone? Your smart fridge? Sorry to break it to you, but this is a Linux-only tool. It depends on Linux keyrings, Linux paths, and general Linux-ness. If you're not using Linux, your options are:
.br
\- Install Linux
.br
\- Cry quietly in a corner
